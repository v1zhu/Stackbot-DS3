# Stackbot-DS3
stackbot project

To run the chatbot first download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stackoverflow/pythonquestions?resource=download.
Then, create a conda enviroment using stackbotenv.yml
Then, run the data_exploration.ipynb, and tf-idf.ipynb in that order. 
After that you can run chatbot.ipynb, and use the chatbot reply function.
Alternativley, download the file at https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/1_JEK_GU4MpafPtzUHgvVThDi9ivsm4kS,
to skip running the data_exploration.ipynb, which takes around 20-30 minutes.
